Churn Data Analysis with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Churn, the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services, is a critical concern for businesses. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques, specifically ANN, to predict and understand factors influencing customer churn.

Key Features

Dataset: The project utilizes a real-world dataset containing customer information, transaction history, and other relevant features.

Artificial Neural Networks: We employ ANN to build a predictive model that can effectively identify potential churn instances based on the provided data.
